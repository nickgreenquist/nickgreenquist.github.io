*My recommender kept handing everyone the same blockbusters. Here's how I got it to surface the niche films that actually fit each user's taste.*

---

Picture a die-hard **WW2 movie buff**. Their watchlist is *Saving Private Ryan*, *Enemy at the Gates*, *Stalingrad*, *The Great Escape*. You ask the recommender: what next?

Here's what my two-tower model returned — **the same user, the same architecture, the same code path — for two versions of the model: one trained with a popularity-debiasing correction, one without.**

![WW2 movie buff: α=0 (left, before) vs α=0.5 (right, after) recommendations, each poster badged with its MovieLens rating count](/blog/assets/PopularityBias/ww2_poster_board.png)

Look at the left wall (the "before"). For a *WW2* fan, the model serves up **Braveheart** (medieval Scotland), **Gladiator** (ancient Rome), **The Lord of the Rings — twice** (Middle-earth), and **The Godfather Part II** (the Mob). **Six of the ten aren't even war movies.** What they *are* is **massively popular** — Braveheart alone has **75,514 ratings**. The model didn't recommend war films.

Now the right wall (the "after"). **The Devil's Brigade. Cross of Iron. Tora! Tora! Tora! Battle of Britain.** Actual war films — most with **a few hundred ratings**, the kind of catalog depth a real enthusiast actually wants. The median recommendation went from **35,547 ratings to 1,083** — roughly **33× less mainstream — and it got *more* on-genre, not less.**

This isn't a WW2 quirk — the same before/after holds for *every* taste I tried. See **six more fans** — high-fantasy, crime, courtroom, vintage sci-fi, giallo horror, and screwball comedy — in the **[Appendix](#appendix-more-examples)** (the courtroom fan's "before" wall is practically the literal IMDb Top 10).

## What's actually going wrong here

This is **popularity bias**, and it's a feedback loop, not a bug:

1. Popular movies get shown more, so they collect more clicks.
2. You train on those clicks, so the model learns *"popular = good."*
3. The model shows popular movies even more. **Go to step 1.**

Left alone, your "personalized" recommender slowly collapses into a **Most Popular shelf** — it hands everyone the same blockbusters and quietly buries the entire long tail of the catalog.

## The fix

This comes straight from a 2020 paper, **["Long-Tail Learning via Logit Adjustment" (Menon et al.)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07314)**. The idea is almost suspiciously simple:

**During training, add a bonus to every movie's score equal to how popular it is — including the negatives.**

```python
# during training only: add each movie's log-popularity to its score
scores = user · movie_embeddings  +  α · log(1 + rating_count)
```

The correction lives entirely in training — you just retrain a new model. Serving doesn't change, which makes it very easy to A/B test online.

The strength is one knob, **α**. At `α=0` you get the blockbuster wall. Crank it too high and you over-correct into pure obscurity. I tuned it to **`α=0.5`** — enough to fix the drift, not so much that *Saving Private Ryan* never shows up.

## How it works

**Why does *adding* a popularity bonus *reduce* popularity bias?** The model trains as a full softmax: each example scores the true next movie against *every* movie in the catalog, and the bonus `α · log(popularity)` is added to *all* of them. So in every training step, popular movies sit among the negatives **with a head start**. The model can only drive the loss down by scoring the *true* movie high enough to **beat those boosted popular negatives** — it's forced to clear a higher bar specifically against popular titles. Repeat over millions of examples and the model learns scores that encode **relevance net of popularity**: a movie ranks high only when you'd like it *more than its raw popularity already predicts*. At serving you drop the bonus and rank on those scores — so a niche film you're a perfect match for can finally outrank a blockbuster everyone half-watches.

> *For the math-inclined:* the objective's optimum drives each raw score toward `log P(movie | you) − α · log(popularity)` — contextual relevance with the base rate divided back out. The bonus exists **only** in training; at serving you rank on the raw score, which has already absorbed that popularity discount. It's the Fisher-consistent result from the paper, not a heuristic.

## Why this beats the usual post-ranking hacks

Most teams fight popularity bias **after** the model — demotion multipliers, per-page blockbuster caps, a bolted-on diversity re-ranker — heuristics nobody fully trusts that rot as the catalog shifts and add a stage to the serving path. Logit adjustment is the opposite: **one line** in the loss, **mathematically grounded** (the Fisher-consistent term from the box above, not an eyeballed constant), and **trivial to maintain** — the whole behavior is one hyperparameter you re-tune in the next retrain if your team finds the debiasing too aggressive.

It's not even two-tower-specific: the correction lives in the softmax, so it drops into *any* model trained with cross-entropy over candidate items — **ranking models included.**

## Does it hold up beyond a couple of cherry-picked fans?

I ran both models over **60,000 held-out recommendation contexts** from 3,000 real users and measured the popularity of what they actually served:

| | Before (α=0) | After (α=0.5) | |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| **Median recommendation popularity** | 26,830 ratings | **13,200** | **↓ 51%** |
| **Catalog coverage** (distinct films ever shown) | 4,485 (48%) | **7,899 (84%)** | **+3,414 movies** |
| **Exposure inequality** (Gini) | 0.907 | **0.776** | more equal |
| **Long-tail share of recommendations** | 0.2% | **4.3%** | **~20×** |

The median recommendation got **half as mainstream**, and the model went from surfacing **48% of the catalog to 84%** — 3,400+ movies that previously had *zero* chance of being recommended to anyone.

## No free lunch: the catch

![The trade in one chart: −4% accuracy on popular hits, +390% on niche long-tail films](/blog/assets/PopularityBias/accuracy_tradeoff.png)

Demoting popular titles isn't free, and any honest writeup has to show the bill. Held-out viewings skew popular — that's literally what popularity bias *is* — so when you down-weight popular movies, some of those held-out favorites get ranked a notch lower. Across the **same ~100,000 held-out viewings**, scored by both models:

| Overall ranking accuracy | α=0 | α=0.5 | |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| **MRR** | 0.120 | 0.115 | −4.3% |
| **Recall@10** | 0.230 | 0.220 | −4.4% |
| **NDCG@10** | 0.135 | 0.129 | −4.1% |

About **4% off the top line.** Real — but look at *where* the bill is paid:

| MRR, split by how popular the held-out movie was | α=0 | α=0.5 | |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| **Popular head** (>1,000 ratings) | 0.124 | 0.119 | −4.7% |
| **Long tail** (≤1,000 ratings) | 0.0031 | 0.0152 | **+390%** |

**The entire cost lands on the popular head** — the blockbusters the model already nails and that barely need a recommender to be found. Meanwhile the **long tail gets 5–12× more accurate** (tail Recall@10 climbs from 0.2% to 3%): still hard in absolute terms, but no longer hopeless — and that's exactly the region where a recommender earns its keep.

So the honest trade is: **give up ~4% accuracy on movies everyone already knows, to make the other 84% of the catalog findable at all.**

## But doesn't that hurt people who *like* the popular stuff?

That −4.7% on the popular head is the objection an interviewer always pushes on: if the model spends its budget discounting popularity, what happens to the user whose taste genuinely *is* mainstream — or who loves a niche but watches its *recent*, popular entries? Does α=0.5 exile them to the long tail too?

No. I ran the same two twins on exactly those users.

**A pure-blockbuster fan** — liked nothing but the four-quadrant canon (*Avatar*, *Titanic*, *Jurassic Park*, *The Dark Knight*, *Inception*, *The Matrix*…), every seed north of 27k ratings. The α=0.5 wall comes back *Spider-Man*, *Batman Begins*, *Iron Man*, *The Incredibles*, *Minority Report*, *Harry Potter* — still blockbusters, all of them. The median recommendation moves **42,700 → 38,700 ratings**: a rounding error. When mainstream really is your taste, the correction leaves you there.

**A modern sci-fi fan** — *Inception*, *Interstellar*, *Ex Machina*, *Arrival*, *District 9*, *Moon* — a genre devotee who watches 2010s films, not 1950s ones. This is the case people *expect* α to break: surely demoting popularity dumps them into *Forbidden Planet* and *2001*? It doesn't. α=0.5 cuts the median recommendation **2.3× (15,100 → 6,500 ratings)** — real work — yet every pick stays modern, on-genre sci-fi: *Oblivion*, *Prometheus*, *Sunshine*, *Primer*, *Coherence*, *Predestination*, all **2004–2014**. The discount surfaced *modern catalog depth*, not vintage classics.

![Modern sci-fi fan: α=0 (left) vs α=0.5 (right). Every pick stays modern, on-genre sci-fi (2002–2015); α=0.5 surfaces deeper modern catalog — median 15,100 → 6,500 ratings.](/blog/assets/PopularityBias/modern_scifi_poster_board.png)

That's the payoff of doing this in the loss rather than with a blunt post-filter: it discounts popularity *relative to how well a title matches you*, so the films you genuinely match still score high. α=0.5 stops the model pushing blockbusters on people who *don't* want them; it doesn't take them from the people who do. (Same result on every profile I checked — modern superhero, Pixar-era animation, action, crime-thriller, post-2000 horror: each stayed in recent, on-genre films.)

## The takeaway

Most "fix the recommender" projects mean a bigger model, more features, more compute. This one was **a single term in a loss function**, grounded in a clean piece of theory, that:

- **halved** the popularity of recommendations,
- nearly **doubled** catalog coverage,
- made the long tail **5–12× more findable**,
- cost ~4% head-accuracy and **zero** added latency.
