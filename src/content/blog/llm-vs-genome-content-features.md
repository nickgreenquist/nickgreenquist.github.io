*A controlled two-tower recommender experiment on MovieLens 32M — and what it means for a team setting up recommendations with no tagging budget.*

> *A hand-curated tag genome and LLM-extracted features are the same idea one generation apart: turn cheap signals into a dense, per-item content matrix. The first took fifteen years of community data to build; the second needs only an item's public web text — synopsis, cast, plot, scraped and run through an LLM — and built the whole corpus in a day.*

## TL;DR

You're building a recommender with user interactions and each item's text — but no tagging team, and little of the curated metadata a dataset like MovieLens is unusually rich in. So: is a per-item **content vector** worth building, and can you build it cheaply?

MovieLens's gold-standard **tag genome** took fifteen years of community data. The cheap alternative — scrape each item's text, extract features with an LLM — covered all \~9,375 movies in **a day** for about **\$200** in API calls. And in that bare setting it **beats a pure-CF floor and edges the genome** on the genome's *own* axes: MRR **0.1155 (LLM) / 0.1148 (genome) / 0.1121 (floor)**. As good as the option you can't afford, and the one you can actually ship.

*The deployed recommender these features power. A user's taste vector is built entirely from movie content — the curated genome tags plus the web-scraped, LLM-extracted features this post compares — with no user-ID embedding.*

## 1. The content-feature problem, and the realistic setting

A two-tower recommender represents each item as an embedding. Collaborative signal — who watched what — carries most of the weight for popular items, but it runs dry exactly where you need help: the long tail, and brand-new items nobody has interacted with yet. That's what a **content vector** is for — a dense, per-item descriptor of what the item *is*, independent of who has touched it. The question is where it comes from.

| | Option 1 — the genome | Option 2 — LLM extraction |
|---|---|---|
| **What it is** | The gold standard: a dense matrix of `rel(movie, tag) ∈ [0,1]`, every cell populated — **1,128 tags × 16,376 movies (≈18M scores)** in this project's MovieLens 32M data (9,734 movies in GroupLens's original 2014 release). | Score the item against a fixed tag taxonomy straight from its own public text — the content vector falls out of the item's description, with no pre-built artifact required. |
| **Catalog coverage** | Only the well-tagged head: those **16,376 movies are just \~19% of MovieLens 32M's 87,585 titles.** Dense *within* its coverage, but it simply does not exist for the sparser \~71k (a structural limit we return to in [§8](#8-limitations)). | Any title with public text — no coverage ceiling. |
| **How it's built** | **Not** mass human labeling (the part most people get wrong), but a **50,203-judgment survey of 676 volunteers** (1–5 scale; a fraction of a percent of the matrix; plus an 85-user pilot), the rest filled by machine learning (a `glmer` regression, MAE 0.211) over features mined from **a large, pre-existing body of free-form community tags** — 186,000 users, 17M ratings, 246,000 tag applications since 1997 — plus crawled IMDb reviews. | Scrape the item's public text (TMDB synopsis, cast, Wikipedia plot) and ask an LLM to score it, with structured (JSON-schema) output (pipeline in [§3](#3-the-cheap-pipeline)). |

**The setting that frames the whole experiment.** A team standing up recommendations for a fresh catalog starts with far less than MovieLens ships with:

- **Doesn't have:** the genome's inputs — years of community tagging, crawled reviews, a relevance survey — *and* most of the *other* curated metadata MovieLens ships with: clean, professionally-assigned **genre labels** on every title, and **306 high-frequency user tags** distilled from a massive crowd-tagging effort.
- **Reliably has:** **interaction logs** and **an item's public text** — and those interactions are usually *implicit* (a click, a watch, a purchase), not the 1–5 explicit ratings MovieLens provides.

So the honest question isn't "genome vs LLM in a metadata-rich model." It's: **in the bare setting a real team actually starts from, does a content vector help at all — and is the LLM's good enough to be the one you build?**

## 2. Why it's a fair fight

To compare content *sources* and nothing else, everything else is held fixed: the same two-tower architecture, the same training recipe, and the same evaluation. Only the content slot changes:

- **A — MovieLens genome tags:** the 1,128-dim genome scores fill the content tower.
- **B — LLM feature tags:** 132 LLM-extracted dims fill it instead.
- **C — no content tags:** the content slot is removed — the floor, what the model scores on its history pool and whatever other features are present.

(Throughout, **A / B / C** are the three content arms — genome / LLM / no-content. The primary experiment runs them in a **base** model; [§6](#6-does-the-curated-metadata-change-the-answer-the-follow-up) re-runs them in a metadata-**rich** one.)

Concretely, in that base model — the three arms written **C′ / A′ / B′** (floor / genome / LLM) — only the content tower differs:

| Arm | User tower | Item tower | Params |
|---|---|---|---|
| **C′** — no content | `1×sum_pool_id(32) = 32` | `movieId(32) = 32` | 383,840 |
| **A′** — + genome | `1×sum_pool_id(32) + genome_ctx(32) = 64` | `genome(32) + movieId(32) = 64` | 472,480 |
| **B′** — + LLM | `1×sum_pool_id(32) + llm_ctx(32) = 64` | `llm(32) + movieId(32) = 64` | 408,736 |

Same single history pool, same shared item-ID embedding, same projection head, same data, loss, and 160k-step schedule — the content tower is the lone structural difference (and, per the params, genome's is the **largest** of the three).

**Nothing in the setup favors the LLM** — two deliberate handicaps press the other way, and the one real asymmetry is neutral at best:

- **The LLM is confined to genome's own taxonomy.** Its 132-dim schema is **derived from genome's top-discriminability tags**, not hand-invented, so both spaces measure the *same axes* (otherwise "LLM ≈ genome" is unmeasurable). That makes the question the sharpest possible: *can LLM extraction match the curated genome on its home turf, tag for tag?* The LLM earns no credit for patterns it could surface from text but that genome never tagged.
- **It isn't even allowed to draft its own.** This answers the obvious objection — *"a greenfield team has no taxonomy to extract against."* It doesn't need one: an LLM can **draft** the taxonomy too, clustering recurring themes across thousands of plots. We deliberately didn't, to keep the fight fair. The genome dependency is a self-imposed rule of *this experiment*, not a requirement of the *method* — so if anything, the result **understates** what an unconstrained LLM pipeline could do.
- **The one real asymmetry — compression — is neutral at best.** Genome feeds **1,128** raw dims into the content tower, the LLM only **132**, but both squeeze to the same 32 — so genome takes the *harder* compression. That's routine and usually helps (find signal, not memorize cells); if it tips anything, it isn't toward the LLM.

**Where this sits.** LLM-manufactured item features aren't new — an active 2023–25 line (KAR, ONCE/GENRE, LLMRec, RLMRec; KAR with a reported production A/B gain at Huawei). What's new is the *comparand*: instead of a weak or absent baseline, this pits them against the **gold-standard human-curated genome, on the same axes**, with a no-content floor (C) to calibrate the lift — in the bare setting most teams actually deploy from.

## 3. The cheap pipeline

The number you'll care about first: **the entire corpus was scraped and feature-extracted in a single day** — one engineer, no annotation team. Because each item is scored independently, the work is parallel; hundreds of model-hours of extraction fan out across concurrent calls and finish inside a day. Set that against the genome's binding input — fifteen years of accrued community data, or the weeks-to-months of dedicated new tagging effort it would take to bootstrap even a rough substitute.

**The pipeline.** For each of the \~9,375 corpus movies (9,366 scraped successfully):

1. **Scrape** — TMDB first: overview, tagline, genres, top-billed cast, director, writers, keywords; supplemented by Wikipedia plot and **factual** prestige indicators (Oscar wins/noms, Criterion status, box-office scale).
2. **Extract** — **six grouped structured-output calls** (themes, tone, setting/era, provenance/structure, factual reception/prestige, visual medium), \~20–30 dimensions each, every call enforced by a JSON schema. Grouping is deliberate: a single 130-dim prompt hits "lost in the middle" and defaults late dimensions to 0.5; six focused calls don't.

**Honest design calls are baked in:**

- **Structured output is non-negotiable** — free-form silently corrupts the tensor.
- **The visual and prestige groups are factual-only** — animation, black-and-white, Oscar-winner, yes; "visually stunning" hallucinated from a synopsis, no.
- **Reception/prestige is its own group** so it can be ablated separately.
- **Extractor:** Claude Sonnet via Claude Code.

**What comes out — three fingerprints.** Nothing below is hand-picked or tuned; these are the raw six-call outputs for three very different films, side by side, top scores per group (each 0–1):

</div>

Every score reads right, and each fingerprint scales to its film. *Alien* fills every group (`cgi_heavy` just 0.3 — practical effects, not CG); *Toy Story* pegs `animated` / `computer_animation` at 1.0 and runs `feel_good` / `comedic` where Alien runs `tense` / `dark`; and *Before Sunrise* — two strangers talking through one night — is honestly spare: a perfect `romance` 1.0 and an `intimate`, `reflective` tone, with little for the genre, visual-medium, or prestige groups to surface (it even half-catches Europe at `france` 0.2, just under the bar). The extractor reports what's in the text and nothing more — same six calls, three very different films, from public text alone.

## 4. Does it work? — the universal setting

The **base model** is what any team actually has on day one — only the two signals that are universal, with none of MovieLens's curated *privileges*:

- **Lacks:** the curated genre one-hot, the 306 user tags, release year — metadata most catalogs don't ship with — **and** the rating-derived history pooling (separate "liked," "disliked," and rating-weighted pools), which needs the explicit 1–5 ratings that *implicit*-feedback systems (clicks, watches) simply don't have.
- **Has:** a single **implicit history pool** — the sum of the ID embeddings of the items a user engaged with, no ratings — plus the **content slot** under test. That's it. This is the setting **90%+ of real recommenders** live in: "here's what this user touched, here's what each item is."

Call the three arms in this base model **C′ / A′ / B′** (floor / genome / LLM). Canonical eval throughout: a held-out **rollback** protocol — for each validation user, context = history so far, target = next watch — over **all 19,134 validation users, n = 382,138** examples (random Hit@250 baseline = 2.7%, so these models are doing real work), plus a smaller **Phase 1** corpus of the 4,461 most-rated movies as an independent replication.

**Primary result — full corpus (n = 382,138):**

| Metric | C′ — pure CF floor | A′ — + genome | B′ — + LLM |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hit@5 | 0.1500 | 0.1538 | **0.1555** |
| Hit@10 | 0.2178 | 0.2229 | **0.2236** |
| Hit@50 | 0.4560 | 0.4644 | **0.4647** |
| NDCG@10 | 0.1259 | 0.1290 | **0.1297** |
| **MRR** | 0.1121 | 0.1148 | **0.1155** |

![Content's lift over a pure-CF floor in the universal setting, and how it vanishes once the curated metadata is added back](/blog/assets/LLMvsGenome/fig1_content_lift.png)

*Figure 1. Left: in the base (universal) model, content beats the pure-CF floor and the ordering C′ < A′ < B′ replicates across both corpora. Right: add the curated genre + user tags + year + rating pools, and the same content slot's lift over the floor collapses to ~0 / negative — genome and LLM go redundant with the cheap metadata ([§6](#6-does-the-curated-metadata-change-the-answer-the-follow-up)).*

Three reads:

1. **Content clears the floor — both sources.** Against a genuine pure-CF baseline, genome adds **+2.4% MRR** (A′−C′ = +0.0027) and the LLM **+3.0%** (B′−C′ = +0.0034). When the model has nothing else to lean on, a content vector earns real lift — the question the metadata-rich setup ([§6](#6-does-the-curated-metadata-change-the-answer-the-follow-up)) structurally couldn't answer.

2. **The LLM matches and slightly edges the genome.** B′ leads A′ on **every metric** and on **every popularity tier** (whole +0.0007, head +0.0007, and ≥0 across Q1–Q4) — a small margin (+0.6% MRR, within single-run noise on any one tier) but a *consistent* one. The cheap, day-one option is not paying a quality tax against fifteen years of curated community data; if anything it noses ahead.

3. **It replicates on an independent corpus.** On the 4,461-movie Phase 1 head (n = 99,846), the same ordering holds: **C′ 0.1133 < A′ 0.1158 < B′ 0.1165** (genome +2.2%, LLM +2.8% over floor). Each arm is still a single training seed, but a result that reproduces across two corpora is firmer than two more seeds on one would be.

A caveat to keep honest: the measurable lift lives on the **popular head** (Q4/Q3), not the deep tail — where, at MovieLens's ≥200-rating floor, every arm is near-zero and the examples are too few to separate (the genuine cold-start regime, where content *should* matter most, can't be benchmarked against the genome at all — [§8](#8-limitations)).

## 5. Why it works — what each source actually knows

Because both spaces sit on the same axes, we can correlate them directly: for each of the 132 LLM dims, compute the **Pearson r** against its mapped genome tag(s) across all 9,375 movies.

> **What's "Pearson r"?** A single number from **−1 to +1** for how tightly two sets of scores move together. Take one axis — say *western* — and line up the genome score and the LLM score across all 9,375 movies: **r ≈ 1** means whenever genome calls a movie western, so does the LLM, movie for movie; **r ≈ 0** means the two are unrelated (knowing one tells you nothing about the other); **r ≈ −1** means they move in opposite directions. So **high r = the LLM and genome agree.**

**Mean r = 0.598, median 0.608; 99 of 132 dims at r ≥ 0.5, none below 0.1.** The two are measuring the same thing. By group: visual **0.70**, setting 0.68, provenance 0.64 agree highest; themes and tone 0.56; **reception lowest at 0.42**.

- **Best axes (factual):** vampires 0.94, documentary 0.89, animated/anime 0.88, western 0.86, WWII 0.86, time-travel 0.85.
- **Worst axes (crowd-sentiment):** imdb_top_250 **0.16**, criterion **0.18**, palme_dor 0.27.

![Distribution of the 132 per-dimension genome-vs-LLM Pearson correlations](/blog/assets/LLMvsGenome/fig2_agreement_hist.png)

*Figure 2. Per-dimension agreement between each LLM feature and its source genome tag, across all 9,375 movies (mean r = 0.60; 99 of 132 dims at r ≥ 0.5, none below 0.1). Agreement is highest on factual axes — genre, era, medium — and lowest on crowd-prestige axes (imdb top 250, criterion): exactly the slice an LLM can't read from a synopsis.*

That split *is* the mechanism. The LLM reproduces nearly all of genome's signal on the axes it can reach from text — genre, setting, provenance, factual medium — which is why B′ matches A′ on the bulk metrics. Where the two genuinely *diverge* is the low-agreement axes, and it cuts both ways:

- **Only genome holds:** **crowd-prestige** ("masterpiece," "imdb top 250"), **fine niche sub-genre** granularity (*The Good, the Bad and the Ugly* — genome's "spaghetti western" + "ennio morricone" vs the LLM's coarser "western"), and **subjective aesthetics**.
- **Only the LLM adds:** clean plot facts genome buries — "artificial_intelligence" for *2001*, "based_on_book" for *Die Hard*, "hitman"/"conspiracy" for *Sicario*.

Critically, genome's exclusive axes are mostly **crowd-sentiment and prestige** — which track popularity more than content — so they don't buy a ranking advantage; in the base model the LLM's plot-facts slightly outweigh them.

**Qualitative color (seed-dependent — not a headline).** Canary top-10s give the two sources different *personalities*: genome leans niche-canon-pure, the LLM leans era-/modern-subgenre but drifts to blockbusters on niche genres. Five disagreements:

| Persona | Genome (A) leans | LLM (B) leans |
|---|---|---|
| Sci-Fi | cerebral — Brazil, Gattaca, Forbidden Planet | popcorn — Fifth Element, T2, Total Recall |
| Crime | drifts to finance — Big Short, Margin Call | nails gritty — Sicario 2, Hell or High Water |
| Western | tight canon — Searchers, Rio Bravo | drifts to war epics — Patton, Braveheart |
| Arthouse | slow-burn — Stalker, In the Mood for Love | prestige — Fight Club, American Beauty |
| Horror | 90s slashers — Scream 2/3, Ring | 2000s gore — Saw II/IV/V, House of Wax |

Treat this strictly as color — the quantitative metrics, not the canary, carry the conclusion.

## 6. Does the curated metadata change the answer? (the follow-up)

The obvious objection to [§4](#4-does-it-work--the-universal-setting): *"you crippled the model — what about a feature-rich one?"* So we re-ran all three arms in the **rich** model — genome's curated genre, 306 user tags, year, and the rating-derived pools added back.

The content lift **collapses for both sources**; on the same protocol the floor even edges the genome:

| Whole-corpus MRR | C — no content | A — genome | B — LLM |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Rich model** | **0.1174** | 0.1144 | 0.1176 |
| Base model ([§4](#4-does-it-work--the-universal-setting)) | 0.1121 | 0.1148 | 0.1155 |

Genome landing *below* the floor (A−C = **−0.0030**) isn't "content is useless" — arm C still has genre, tags, and year, so genome is just a **second copy** of what's already there. The tell is what each arm *loses* when that metadata is removed:

| Arm | rich → base (whole-corpus MRR) | Δ |
|---|---|---|
| Floor (C → C′) | 0.1174 → 0.1121 | **−0.0053** |
| LLM (B → B′) | 0.1176 → 0.1155 | **−0.0021** |
| Genome (A → A′) | 0.1144 → 0.1148 | **+0.0004** |

This **substitution ladder** (replicated on Phase 1) is the whole result. Genome loses *nothing* dropping genre/tags — it reconstructs them, because genome tags essentially *are* that metadata in another form. The LLM loses a little: its plot/tone/theme/cast basis is partly **orthogonal**, so it only *partially* backfills. The floor loses the most. That genome > LLM > none substitutability is direct evidence the **LLM features overlap *less* with cheap metadata — i.e. carry more genuinely additive signal**.

Net: *with* a rich metadata stack an extra content vector is redundant; *without* one (most teams), it's a real +2–3% lift — the LLM's the less redundant — with the true lift for a given team somewhere inside that bracket, closer to the base end the less curated metadata they own.

## 7. The payoff: feasibility, speed, cost

Here's where "good enough" cashes out. The point was never that the LLM features are 1% better — it's that they're the option a real team can actually build. Dimension by dimension (every replication dollar figure below is a labeled **estimate** — the genome papers publish none):

| Dimension | Genome (GroupLens) | LLM extraction (this repo) |
|---|---|---|
| Human labeling | 50,203 judgments (676 volunteers); **\~\$5k–23k (central \~\$10k)** to buy as crowd labor today *(est)* | **Zero** |
| Binding prerequisite | \~15 years of community tagging (186k users / 17M ratings / 246k tag applications, since 1997) + crawled IMDb reviews — accrues with usage, not buyable quickly | The item's own text — exists day one |
| Specialist engineering | LSI/SVD features + rating-affinity + text-mining + a 6-model regression bake-off; **weeks–months** *(est)* | Scraper + schema derivation + 6 grouped prompts; **a few engineer-days** |
| Direct \$ (this corpus) | \~\$10k survey + tens of \$k labor, *only if you already own that tagging history*; **\~\$85–210k** to hand-curate without it *(est)* | **\~\$0 marginal as run**; **\~\$170–220** if reproduced on the metered API (Sonnet \$3/\$15) |
| Wall-clock to build, full corpus | Accreted over \~15 years of community use | **\~1 day** for all \~9,375 items — independent calls, fanned out in parallel |
| Time-to-first-vector, new item | Effectively **never** until the crowd tags it | **Sub-hour**, zero-shot from text |
| Maintenance / new domain | Re-survey + re-crawl + re-train; new domain = redo everything | Parallel API calls per item |
| Quality (universal setting) | A′: MRR 0.1148 | B′: 0.1155 — **matches, edges ahead**, +2–3% over the floor |

Three legs:

1. **Feasibility / build-vs-build.** The genome needs a mature tagging history + specialist research; the LLM needs only item text. The LLM side is cheap but **not "\$0"** — full-corpus extraction ran in a single day, consuming \~84% of one week's Sonnet quota on a Claude Max plan (≈\$0 marginal under the subscription; \~\$170–220 if reproduced on the metered API). Direct-dollar savings run roughly 1–3 orders of magnitude — but the durable claim is **feasibility, not price**: for a company without that tagging history, the genome path isn't expensive, it's *unavailable*.
2. **Speed / cold-start.** Time-to-first-content-vector for a brand-new item: **sub-hour** (scrape + six calls) versus the genome's **effectively never** — its input features are all zero until the crowd tags the item.
3. **Cold-start bootstrapping (enabled-by, *not measured here*).** A sub-hour content vector lets you compute content-space nearest neighbors and seed a new item into the traffic of users who already get its most-similar items — warming up its collaborative embedding on far fewer impressions (cf. DropoutNet, NeurIPS 2017). This experiment didn't build or measure that; but it validates the premise it rests on — the r≈0.60 agreement and the Toy Story / Godfather similarity checks show the content NN is meaningful. Mind the axis, though: NN-seeding is a *rich-content-vs-no-content* benefit, so genome enables it too; it's **LLM-specific only at true cold start**, where genome doesn't exist to NN on in the first place.

**"Neural ≠ cheaper" sidebar.** The 2021 genome refresh (TagDL, a PyTorch MLP) bought \~2.6% MAE and changed *none* of the data prerequisites — same survey, same tagging history. And the genome team's own 2026 cross-domain paper hit exactly the prerequisite wall extending to Amazon — *"the absence of … item-tag ratings and tag applications"* — had to reuse old survey labels, and took a measured accuracy hit. The strongest evidence that the prerequisite is binding comes from the people who built the genome.

## 8. Limitations

Limitations, stated plainly:

- **Single seed per arm — but cross-corpus replicated.** No seed ensembles or CIs — but the ordering (C′ < A′ < B′, B′ edging A′) and the substitution ladder both replicate across the full and Phase 1 corpora, firmer than extra seeds on one. Read per-tier A′-vs-B′ gaps ≤ 0.0007 MRR as "matches" — carried by direction, not magnitude.
- **The "universal" floor isn't perfectly implicit.** The base model's history pool is un-rated (truly implicit), but the content arms' *user-side* pooling still rating-weights each item's content vector. A strictly implicit deployment would weight uniformly; the effect is small (just how content is averaged over history), but it's a real residual behind the "no ratings" claim.
- **Two separate filterings, easy to conflate — we filtered neither genome one.** *(1) Our corpus:* all arms train/eval on the **9,375 movies with >200 ratings** — our cutoff on MovieLens 32M's 87,585 titles, and both sources fully cover it (genome scores all 9,375), so the fight is scale-matched. *(2) The genome's own ceiling:* GroupLens only ever published genome for **16,376 movies (\~19% of the catalog)** — the other **\~81%** are too sparsely tagged for their model. So our eval can't see the gap that matters most: across that \~81% the genome simply **doesn't exist**, while the LLM scores any title from its text (\~\$1.6–2k metered for the whole catalog, *est*). The numbers almost certainly **understate** the feasibility gap.
- **A true cold-start head-to-head is structurally impossible.** Cold start is where an LLM vector should pay off ([§7](#7-the-payoff-feasibility-speed-cost)), but it can't be benchmarked *against the genome* — the genome doesn't exist there. And the lift we *do* measure lives on the popular head: at the ≥200-rating floor every arm is near-zero on the deep tail, so the real cold-start regime is unmeasured (and has no genome arm to compare against anyway).
- **Single LLM.** Claude Sonnet only, no cheaper-model bake-off — so this supports "Sonnet-class extraction matches genome," **not** "any cheap model would."
- **The shared taxonomy is genome's — by design, to handicap the LLM ([§2](#2-why-its-a-fair-fight)), not because the method needs one.** We held the LLM to genome's tags so the match is tag-for-tag on its home turf. The residual: we *showed* an LLM can fill a curated taxonomy to genome quality; an LLM *drafting* a richer one (which the scrape data would support) is argued in [§2](#2-why-its-a-fair-fight), not benchmarked.
- **Movies are a text-rich, easy case.** Every item ships with a Wikipedia plot, TMDB cast, and reviews — the extractor never worked from thin text. Whether it still tracks a gold-standard signal on items with three sentences of description is unmeasured.
- **Cost is amortized, not zero.** The \~\$0 is *marginal dollars* under a flat-rate subscription, not a per-call API figure.
- **Crowd-sentiment is a scope choice, not a hard limit.** Genome's pure-sentiment tags ("masterpiece," "overrated") are where the LLM trails (r≈0.16–0.18) — not because an LLM can't read sentiment, but because we scraped only Wikipedia + TMDB. Pointed at reviews, the same pipeline recovers it.
- **Prestige-as-popularity leakage.** Scraped box-office / IMDb-rating in the reception group are quasi-popularity signals, in tension with isolating *content* — which is why that group is separately ablatable.
- **Possible training-data contamination — and it cuts toward the LLM.** MovieLens is heavily discussed online and the genome tags are public, so the extractor may be partly *reciting* genome knowledge rather than reading the synopsis. That would inflate the r≈0.60 agreement on this corpus specifically — a fresh-catalog replication is the clean check.

## 9. Takeaway

**No pre-existing tagging history? Scrape the text.** For the recommender most teams are actually building — implicit interactions, item text, none of MovieLens's curated metadata — **LLM-extracted content features are the pragmatic default.** They earn a real lift over collaborative filtering alone, on the gold-standard genome's *own* axes — matching it and, by a small but consistent margin, edging it. (Already own a rich curated-metadata stack? Then an extra content vector is redundant either way, and the genome's fifteen-year provenance buys you nothing you couldn't scrape in a day.)

The deeper point: **genome and LLM are two generations of the same idea** — turn cheap signals into a dense content matrix. GroupLens did it with a 50,000-judgment survey and regression, standing on fifteen years of community data; the LLM does it from the item's own text, dropping the community, the tag-data dependence, and the cold-start wall in one move. It trades a thin slice of crowd-curated nuance to run **on day one, for any item, at any company.** Fifteen years of provenance, or a day of scraping, for the same axes. For the content-feature problem most teams actually have, that's the trade you want.

## Appendix — Sources & notes

*Results come from a held-out rollback evaluation under a low-variance protocol (seeded, 160k steps) — full corpus all 19,134 validation users / 382,138 ranking examples, replicated on a 4,461-movie head corpus. Genome-construction facts are drawn from GroupLens's tag-genome work (Vig, Sen & Riedl, 2010/2012) and its later cost/feasibility line (TagDL, SIGIR '21; book genome, CHIIR '22; cross-domain genome, CHIIR '26), with cost anchors from public MTurk/Prolific and Pandora figures. Every dollar figure is a labeled estimate — the genome papers publish none. Full code, data pipeline, and per-tier eval outputs are in the repository.*
