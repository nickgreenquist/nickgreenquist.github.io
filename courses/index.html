The class will focus on a broad spectrum of big data computational problems, algorithms and platforms. The class will be centered around several big data case studies in commercial use to understand big data and machine learning tasks across different domains and provide an in-depth understanding of the problems and algorithms used in each domain. From the computational platform perspective, this class covers popular and widely used commercial platforms including Hadoop and Mapreduce variants, Spark, streaming platforms, Tensorflow, ML platforms (MLBase, MxNet) and GPU platforms. The goal of this class is to educate students about the algorithms and systems techniques used to build scalable big data and ML platforms and how these platforms are used in the real world.
