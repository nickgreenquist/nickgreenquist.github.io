The class will focus on a broad spectrum of big data computational problems, algorithms and platforms. The class will be centered around several big data case studies in commercial use to understand big data and machine learning tasks across different domains and provide an in-depth understanding of the problems and algorithms used in each domain. From the computational platform perspective, this class covers popular and widely used commercial platforms including Hadoop and Mapreduce variants, Spark, streaming platforms, Tensorflow, ML platforms (MLBase, MxNet) and GPU platforms. The goal of this class is to educate students about the algorithms and systems techniques used to build scalable big data and ML platforms and how these platforms are used in the real world.

In this class we will look at how to construct these distributed systems, in particular looking at why this is more complex than building applications running on a single machine, and present abstraction and design techniques for building distributed systems. We will focus on a solving a variety of common problems in these systems including consensus, consistency, naming, fault tolerance, etc.</p>
                                        <p>This is a graduate-level course, but undergraduates are welcome! The course itself will consist of a series of lectures and will require reading research papers.</p>

Many computations can be performed much faster on the GPU than on a traditional processor. This is why GPUs are present now in almost all computers; and the majority of Top 500 supercomputers in the world are built around GPUs. GPUs are no longer restricted to graphics applications but are now used for a diverse set of applications and domains. This introduces the concept of general-purpose GPUs or GPGPUs, which is the main subject of this course. This course serves as a capstone for the MSCS program.</p>

This is followed by a discussion of basic macroeconomic concepts including inflation, unemployment, and economic growth and fluctuations. The next topic is national income accounting, which is the measurement of macroeconomic variables. The latter part of the course focuses on the development of one or more macroeconomic models, a discussion of the role of money in the macroeconomy, the aggregate supply-aggregate demand framework, and other topics the individual instructor may choose.</p>

                                            <p>The world is full of uncertainty: accidents, storms, unruly financial markets, noisy communications. The world is also full of data. Probabilistic modeling and the related field of statistical inference are the keys to analyzing data and making scientifically sound predictions.</p>
                                            <p>Probabilistic models use the language of mathematics. But instead of relying on the traditional "theorem - proof" format, we develop the material in an intuitive -- but still rigorous and mathematically precise -- manner. Furthermore, while the applications are multiple and evident, we emphasize the basic concepts and methodologies that are universally applicable.</p>    
                                            <p>The course covers all of the basic probability concepts, including:</p>
                                            <p> - multiple discrete or continuous random variables, expectations, and conditional distributions</p>
                                            <p> - laws of large numbers</p>
                                            <p> - the main tools of Bayesian inference methods</p>
                                            <p> - an introduction to random processes (Poisson processes and Markov chains)</p>
                                            <p>The contents of this course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding MIT class (Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability) -- a course that has been offered and continuously refined over more than 50 years. It is a challenging class, but it will enable you to apply the tools of probability theory to real-world applications or your research.</p>

Do words like “algebra’ and “calculus” fill you with dread? Has it been so long since you studied math at school that you’ve forgotten much of what you learned in the first place.</p>
                                            <p>You’re not alone. machine learning and AI are built on mathematical principles like Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability, Statistics, and Optimization; and many would-be AI practitioners find this daunting. This course is not designed to make you a mathematician. Rather, it aims to help you learn some essential foundational concepts and the notation used to express them. The course provides a hands-on approach to working with data and applying the techniques you’ve learned.</p>
                                            <p>This course is not a full math curriculum; it’s not designed to replace school or college math education. Instead, it focuses on the key mathematical concepts that you’ll encounter in studies of machine learning. It is designed to fill the gaps for students who missed these key concepts as part of their formal education, or who need to refresh their memories after a long break from studying math.</p>

TypeScript lets you write JavaScript the way you want to. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It works on Any browser. Any host. Any OS. TypeScript is open source and has attracted the attention of a big community of web developers who are continuously contributing to the wealth of the language making it the language for web development. TypeScript brings all the next-generation features of ECMAScript 6 like Arrow Functions, Decorators, Generics, Modules and Interfaces. In this course, you'll learn all the basics of TypeScript and will have hands-on using features of TypeScript such as types, optional static types, classes, interfaces, and modules. You will learn how TypeScript has solved many issues developers have suffered from with JavaScript. You will learn how TypeScript has made web development more fun and easier. You will be doing all this using the most recent released version of the language TypeScript 2.3.</p>
